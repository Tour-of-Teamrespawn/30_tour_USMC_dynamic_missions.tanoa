		<font size='20' align='center' color='#0080ff'>DYNAMIC MISSION CREATOR</font>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		The Dynamic Mission Creator (DMC) allows you to create missions ingame. You can access the interface from the <marker name='TOUR_Mkr_HQ'>Officer</marker> located in the main airbase building.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		You can create missions from a list of mission type, and tailor the area of operations, enemy factions, types and numbers to your requirements. Further options exist for the environment and ambient life within the AO. The user interface will guide you through the setup process if anything is missing. Once complete, the DMC will generate a task, confirming the mission is ready to start.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		The DMC mission maker should take care when selecting enemy numbers, to ensure good performance of clients and server. The mission enemy sizes, spawn points and patrols are randomized each time based upon the parameters selected. It can be good idea to setup a mission to pre-check performance when selecting larger numbers of enemies.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		To end the mission, a group leader can access the DMC interface back at base, and will be prompted to confirm the request. The mission can be ended whether or not the objective has been completed. It is also possible to complete the mission from the Support Interface. This can only be done if all the players are outside of the active mission area of operations.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Throughout the game, civilian vehciles will be driving around the map. But be careful... there can also be enemy vehicles and infantry patrols active outside of the AO.

		<font size='20' align='center' color='#0080ff'>BASE OF OPERATIONS</font>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<t size='0.85' font='TahomaB' color='#D0D0D0' align='left'>
		Your base of operations is <marker name='TOUR_base'>Tuvanaka Airbase</marker>. In addition there is an <marker name='TOUR_FOB'>FOB</marker>, which can be accessed by walking into the back of the folded helicopter at the main airbase. You can also teleport back by walking into the shed in the FOB, ajdacent to the repair centre. It is equiped with all the weapons, vehicles and services you should need to engage in a single or series of DMC objectives. The DMC mission maker should define any limitations to the mission leader, in order to enhance play, guide mission flow or influence difficulty.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Military markers can be found on your map to show the different asset locations at the airbase. For more detailed information, see the ASSETS tab in the briefing menu.
